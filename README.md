In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
